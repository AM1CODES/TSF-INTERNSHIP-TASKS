# TSF---INTERNSHIP---TASKS
This repository contains all of my Tasks that i completed during my Internship period with The Sparks Foundation.

# Task - 1
In this task we were provided with a dataset that contained the amount of hours a student studied and the marks that they scored. We were also given a user input of time - 9.25 Hrs and we had to predict how much a student would score after studying for that amount of time. We had to apply Linear regression to find the solution.<br>
We were able to build a decent model which made a prediction very close to the expected output and it would have been much better if we had a bit bigger data set.<br>

# Task - 2
In this task we were asked to carry out Exploratory data analysis on IPL data set. We were given data set that contained individual match information and we needed to find out factors for teams win, and basically try and understand the whole data set using EDA techniques. I carried out EDA on different columns in order to gain an in-depth knowledge about how toss decisions affected final game decisions, who were able to get the most man of the matches, did the teams win more games on their home ground or away and so on.<br>

# Task - 3
In this task, we were given the Iris data set and we were asked to create a classifier that could classify between the various flower species when the user gave an input. We were asked to use DecisionTree in order to make the classifier.<br>
We were able to make a classifeier that gave some decent results and was able to classify the different species of Iris flower.<br>
